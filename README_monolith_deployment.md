### Provision VM to have app folder and nginx on start up:
1. First we need to make a script which will allow Nginx to run on start up:

2. In our "Vagrantfile" we need to add provision:

3. Next we need to sync app folders. (download necessary folders and
extract them info our "Virtualisation"). If everything is right
they should appear on our VS code app.

4. Next wee need to sync the app folder. To do that we need
to add new command in our VS Code

5. To check if everything works:
- first in VS code terminal use `vagrant up`
- next we need to use `vagrant ssh` in GitBash (make sure that you're in virtualisation file).

- now we can check if our app folder is synced by using `ls` command.

6. Next step in VS code terminal we need to navigate to environment folder 
`cd environment` and next `cd spec-tests`
7. To run tests we need to install bundle. Type in `gem install bundle`.

8. Next we can use command `bundle` to bundle up all the tests.
9. Next command is `rake spec` to run all the tests.

10. After checking all the test few of them are failed. To fix it we need to
install all the missing packages: nodejs/pm2.
11. To do that in GitBash we need to navigate to our main Vagrantfile by using `cd`.
12. Next we need to install NodeJS by using `sudo apt-get install nodejs -y`.
13. Next we need to install python software properties by using `sudo apt-get install python-software-properties -y`.
14. Next we need to install specific version that we want to install `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash â€“`
to make sure that it's nodejs version 6.x.
15. Next command is again `sudo apt-get install nodejs -y` and to check everythin  `nodejs --version`.
16. The last Package that we need to install is "pm2" (package manager for Node - we need it to actualy unpackage the app).
To do that run `sudo npm install pm2 -g`.
17. In VS Code terminal we can run `rake spec` and it will show if all the tests passed.

18. Next we need to go back to GitBash, go into app folder by using `cd app`.
19. One of the last steps is to install the app by using `npm install`.
20. Next use `node app.js` and if everything works fine this should pop up:

![port_3000.png](files%2Fport_3000.png)

21. To check if everything works in web browser paste the IP `http://192.168.10.100` plus add `:3000`.
